== Functions

So far, we've learned how to run code multiple times through loops. What if we could save a bit of code and run it when it's convenient for us? For example, we may want to print out a menu, or show some information we've stored. 

To do this, we have to create a function. A function is nothing more than a set of directions. Think of them like a recipe. When you go to your favorite sandwich shop, you don't give them detailed instructions on how to make a meatball sub. You just say "Hey, I'd like a meatball sub, please." They already know how to make it!

A function is like that: You tell Python how to do something once, and it remembers how to do it for the rest of the program.
